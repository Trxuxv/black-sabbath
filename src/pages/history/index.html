                            Black Sabbath, British band whose bludgeoning brand of rock defined heavy metal in the
                            1970s. The principal members were Ozzy Osbourne (byname of John Osbourne; b. December 3,
                            1948, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England), Terry (“Geezer”) Butler (b. July 17, 1949,
                            Birmingham), Tony Iommi (b. February 19, 1948, Birmingham), and Bill Ward (b. May 5, 1948,
                            Birmingham).

                            Osbourne, Butler, Iommi, and Ward, schoolmates in Birmingham in the late 1960s, formed the
                            blues bands Polka Tulk and Earth. These evolved into Black Sabbath, which was named after a
                            Butler song inspired by a Boris Karloff movie. The band cultivated a dark and foreboding
                            image with ominous guitar riffs, slow-churn tempos, and Osbourne’s sullen vocals. Black
                            Sabbath’s lyrics, soaked in occult imagery, and coarse musicianship were reviled by critics
                            and shunned by radio programmers, but constant touring turned them into stars, and songs
                            such as “Paranoid,” “Iron Man,” and “War Pigs” became metal classics. By the end of the
                            1970s they had sold millions of records and had become the standard by which virtually every
                            heavy metal band had to measure itself. Osbourne left the band in the late 1970s, and Ward
                            and Butler later followed him out. Iommi kept the Black Sabbath name alive throughout the
                            1980s with a variety of musicians, and Osbourne forged a solo career marked by outrageous
                            drug-fueled antics, best-selling albums, and the hugely popular MTV reality show The
                            Osbournes (2002–05), which followed Osbourne and his family. In the 1990s the original
                            lineup reunited on several occasions and released the live album Reunion (1998). It featured
                            the single “Iron Man,” which earned the group its first Grammy Award, for best metal
                            performance. Black Sabbath was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.
                            In 2013 the Rick Rubin-produced 13—the first Black Sabbath studio recording in 25 years on
                            which Osbourne, Butler, and Iommi played together—topped charts around the world. The band
                            won its second Grammy for the single “God Is Dead?” Black Sabbath embarked upon a farewell
                            tour in 2015, with a final performance two years later; a live album and film, The End: Live
                            in Birmingham, commemorated the show. The band received a Grammy Award for lifetime
                            achievement in 2019.

                            Ozzy Osbourne, byname of John Michael Osbourne, (born December 3, 1948, Birmingham,
                            England), British musician who gained a loyal following as the vocalist for the heavy metal
                            group Black Sabbath before embarking on a successful solo career.
                            <br><br>
                            Raised in a working-class family, Osbourne dropped out of school at age 15 and held several
                            low-paying jobs. He also engaged in petty crime and at 17 was imprisoned for two months for
                            burglary. After his release, he sang in a number of local rock groups, eventually forming
                            the rock band Earth with guitarist Tony Iommi. To avoid confusion with another band of the
                            same name, the group changed its name to Black Sabbath—after an old Boris Karloff movie. The
                            group developed a grinding, ominous sound, based on the blues but intensely amplified, and
                            drew attention with its tendency to reference the occult in its lyrics. In February 1970
                            Black Sabbath released its eponymous first album and quickly developed a following in both
                            Britain and the United States.
                            <br>
                            The band released albums each year through the mid-1970s, except 1974. After the tour for
                            Never Say Die (1978), Osbourne left the band. A period of despair and drug abuse led to
                            Osbourne’s divorce from his first wife, Thelma Mayfair. He then met and married Sharon
                            Arden, who encouraged him to start a career as a solo artist. His first effort, achieved
                            with the primary help of guitarist Randy Rhoads, was Blizzard of Ozz (1980). A multiplatinum
                            success, thanks in part to the standout single “Crazy Train,” it was followed by the equally
                            popular Diary of a Madman (1981), which sold more than five million copies. A defining
                            moment in Osbourne’s career came on the tour for the album, when, thinking that someone in
                            the audience had thrown him a rubber toy, Osbourne bit off the head of a live bat.
                            <br><br>
                            Osbourne found his first solo Top 40 hit with “Mama, I’m Coming Home” from the album No More
                            Tears (1991), and in 1993 he won a Grammy Award for best metal performance for the song “I
                            Don’t Want to Change the World.” Despite announcing his retirement in 1992, he continued
                            recording through the decade. Ozzfest, an annual summer music festival featuring heavy metal
                            acts organized by Osbourne and his wife, began in 1996 and toured throughout the United
                            States and, in some years, parts of Europe. By the end of the 1990s, Osbourne had reunited
                            the original members of Black Sabbath for a new album and tour, and in 1999 the band won a
                            Grammy for best metal performance for the song “Iron Man.” In 2013 Osbourne made his first
                            studio record, 13, with Black Sabbath after a 35-year absence. <br>
                            In 2001 the reality television show The Osbournes, which focused on the life of Osbourne and
                            his family, premiered on MTV, and within two months it had become the third highest-rated
                            offering on cable television. The hugely popular show ran until 2005. The family later
                            starred in the reality series The Osbournes Want to Believe (2020– ) and the special The
                            Osbournes: Night of Terror (2020), both focused on paranormal investigations. In March 2006
                            Osbourne and the members of Black Sabbath were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
                            In 2007 he released his first solo studio album in six years, Black Rain, and he followed
                            with Scream (2010) and Ordinary Man (2020). <br>
                            Osbourne occasionally acted, playing himself or a comparable rock star in such movies as
                            Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and the 2016 remake of Ghostbusters. He also lent his
                            voice to the animated feature Gnomeo & Juliet (2011) and its sequel, Sherlock Gnomes (2018),
                            as well as Trolls World Tour (2020).
